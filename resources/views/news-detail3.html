                           “Beijing consumes 2 million disposable tableware every day, of which 400,000 foam plastic meals, accounting for 20%, 30% of the national environmental protection requirements, and the remaining 50% are unqualified products.” Yesterday, engaged once Dong Jinshi, an expert on packaging and environmental protection for more than 10 years, said that unqualified disposable plastic lunch boxes, bowls and trays add a lot of waste plastics and fillers. When exposed to heat or oil, they can release cancer-causing chemicals. It is a serious hazard to human health. According to the "Xinmin Evening News" report, Dong Jinshi is the deputy director of the China Packaging Resources Comprehensive Utilization Committee.

                        <p class="news_detail_text">
                           Yesterday, Dong Jinshi, who participated in the one-off tableware survey in China, said that half of the unqualified meals in the Beijing market came from Yongqing County in Hebei and Jinghai District in Tianjin, and the other half came from underground factories and small workshops in Beijing. An underground factory in Tianjin Jinghai District, which produces disposable tableware, found that the raw materials used in this factory were all waste plastics, and a large amount of harmful substances such as industrial paraffin banned by the state were added. It is understood that 20% of the inferior lunch boxes in Beijing are from the region. Dong Jinshi introduced that the market price of 1 ton of polypropylene (PP) on the market is around 11,000 yuan, and the market price of 1 ton of filler is not even 2,000 yuan. This is the reason why many manufacturers illegally add fillers. The long-term intake of illegally added industrial paraffin may cause cancer. Dong Jinshi said,

                           Powder, calcium carbonate, etc. actually exceeded 50%, which caused the harmful substances in the tableware to seriously exceed the standard. With hot water and a microwave, the harmful substances will dissolve in the food. Long-term intake will lead to indigestion, gallstones and liver system diseases. If the tableware contains industrial paraffin, it may even cause cancer.

The box was also found to be problematic.

                           Harm of inferior paper cups:
                        </p>
                        <p class="news_detail_text">
                           We first break down the inferior paper cup. Its composition is: paper, printing ink, industrial paraffin, and coated paper. Let's explain it in turn.
                        </p>
                        <p class="news_detail_text">
                           I. Paper: Many manufacturers do not use food grade wood pulp paper for maximum benefit. The shoddy is everywhere. If the paper quality is poor (recycled waste paper), bleaching powder and fluorescent whitening agent are used, which is unrecognizable to ordinary consumers.
                        </p>
                        <p class="news_detail_text">
                           Second, printing ink: In the era when production costs are everything, the national standards for printing inks seem to be ineffective. Therefore, inks containing benzene and toluene are also flooding the market. After the printed paper cups are stacked, the ink is likely to contaminate the inner wall of the paper cup.
                        </p>
                        <p class="news_detail_text">
                           Third, industrial paraffin: If the paper cup is not waterproof, can it still contain water? Therefore, there is a paper cup that has been waxed. The wax contains a harmful substance called "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons", and the melting point of the wax is 40 °, and the oil can dissolve the wax, as you know.
                        </p>
                        <p class="news_detail_text">
                           Fourth, coated paper: Generally speaking, everyone is so called, but it is actually a polyethylene plastic film. Many paper cups have replaced paraffin with coated paper. However, the outer wall of the "protective" cup without paraffin may be moldy after damp, and the inner wall of the cup will be contaminated with mold. Regarding this plastic film, if it is not a food grade material, harmful substances are decomposed at high temperatures.
                        </p>
                        <p class="news_detail_text">
                           In addition, inferior paper cups were found to contain bisphenol A. According to the determination of bisphenol A content in some daily necessities by experts from Nanjing Medical University, the results showed that the bisphenol A content in the disposable paper cup was 30 times that of the disposable plastic cup, and the bisphenol A content in the rainwater was More than five times the pure water in the water dispenser.
                        </p>
                        <p class="news_detail_text">
                           About plastic cups:
                        </p>
                        <p class="news_detail_text">
                           Simply put, the commonly used plastic cup materials are PP and PS. PP is resistant to high temperatures and microwaves, so the locks and locks you have used are made of PP. PS is not resistant to high temperatures, so it is often used in cold drink packaging. In the production process, the plastic cup is more sanitary than the paper cup, because the production process of the plastic cup is simple, and the package is immediately packaged after being cooled at a high temperature. There are printing, cutting paper, film, reel, and curling on the paper cup. I don't know how many hands I have to touch.
                        </p>
                        <p class="news_detail_text">
                           But then again, plastic cups are ok, but not in China. I was even asked if I could use recycled plastic in a plastic cup. I was despised in my heart, but I could not show it. I told him that the recycled plastic had impurities and the cup made was not beautiful. Recycling materials are only one of them. I believe that few people do this. Because the market is fierce. A transparent plastic cup can be seen at a glance. Is there still invisible? It is an additive. Gypsum powder (milk white cup)? Toughener? antifreeze? Whether it is harmful or not, I don’t know it for the time being. However, it can be confirmed that the plastic cup that China exports to the United States is “food-grade pure PP”. People can't tolerate a little bit of impurities in their eyes, and if they fail, they will let you go home!
                        </p>
                        <p class="news_detail_text">
                           In fact, in our daily life, we are in contact with the crisper, packing box, plastic bag, food bag, plastic cup, we must carefully observe, if the product used is transparent and transparent, you can use it safely, because basically it is polypropylene raw material and Polyethylene raw materials are processed at one time. No additives or additives are added during the process. If the lunch boxes that are found to be used during the process are other colors, especially milky white, please do not use them because the masterbatch raw materials are added during the processing. Or toner, a large amount of milky white added filler masterbatch to reduce costs.
